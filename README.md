# Caroline's Final Project: The Oregon Trail Game Remake
final-project-carolinezhao created by GitHub Classroom

## Description
This game is modelled after the Oregon Trail computer game series that was made to teach students about the hardships faced on the Oregon Trail. Like the original game, the player starts from Independence, Missouri, and has to make it to the state of Oregon to settle. Throughout the game, players may face diseases, thieves, and many other sources of peril that will make their journey challenging to go through. However, there are always opportunities to thrive, and a small amount of strategic pioneers will be able to make it to Oregon before time runs out!

To play the game, no detailed instructions are needed, as all the information is provided on prompts displayed on the screen.

### NOTE
* Was absent from 1/2 to 1/10 due to appendicitis and surgery recovery, so did not get the opportunity to constantly update each day
* Update history is sometimes in chunks because some editing at home was done in repl (installation of vscode/python didn't work on Mac because Mac has python2.7 already installed so pygame install goes on 2.7, not 3.8; couldn't figure out how to fix)
