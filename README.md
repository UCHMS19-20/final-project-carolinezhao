final-project-carolinezhao created by GitHub Classroom

## Description
This game is modelled after the Oregon Trail computer game series that was made to teach students about the hardships faced on the Oregon Trail. Like the original game, the player starts from Independence, Missouri, and has to make it to the state of Oregon to settle. Throughout the game, players may face diseases, thieves, and many other sources of peril that will make their journey challenging to go through. However, there are always opportunities to thrive, and a small amount of strategic pioneers will be able to make it to Oregon before time runs out!

To play the game, no further instructions are needed, just follow the prompts on the screen.
