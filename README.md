# Caroline's Final Project: The Oregon Trail Game Remake

## Description
This game is modelled after the Oregon Trail computer game series that was made to teach students about the hardships faced on the Oregon Trail. Like the original game, the player starts from Independence, Missouri, and has to make it to the state of Oregon to settle. Throughout the game, players may face diseases, thieves, and many other sources of peril that will make their journey challenging to go through. However, there are always opportunities to thrive, and a small amount of strategic (and lucky) pioneers will be able to make it to Oregon before time runs out!

To play the game, no detailed instructions are needed, as all the information is provided on prompts displayed on the screen.

### NOTE
* Was absent from 1/2 to 1/10 due to appendicitis and the subsequent surgery/recovery, so did not get the opportunity to constantly update each day (therefore, may be missing some work in between checkpoints)
* Update history is in large-ish chunks because most work was done in repl.it (I had completed a large chunk of my code during my absence, but I had trouble installing vscode/python on the Mac because Mac has python2.7 already installed so the pygame install goes on 2.7, not 3.8, and I couldn't figure out how to fix it. The best place to test my code *that I knew of* was in a repl, so I just did that and then uploaded the changed text to github every once in awhile)
